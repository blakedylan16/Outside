# Outside

My goal is to create an app that facilitates event-finding and organizing for younger people. There is a multitude of platforms on which people look for, host, and RSVP to parties. I want to make an app that makes it possible to see events across platforms and more importantly, see what parties my friends have RSVP'd or bought tickets to.

Right now, we are in the process of getting more familiar with Swift. Look to my repository "Memorize" to watch my progress.
